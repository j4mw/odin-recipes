    <h3>Description</h3>    
    <p><em>Butterscotch Cookies are soft, chewy, and made with only a few basic ingredients! This simple and easy cookie recipe can be prepped quickly and is ready to bake after only 20 minutes in the freezer.</em></p>

    <h3 id='recipe'>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>11 ounces butterscotch chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream together butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth about 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract. Then add one egg at a time, mixing until combined between adding them.</li>
        <li>In a measuring cup combine flour, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer running on low slowly add the flour. Mix until just combined. Then add butterscotch chips and mix until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Chill dough for 20 minutes in the freezer or for 40 minutes in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Use a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop to drop balls of dough onto a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper and bake for 10-12 minutes until edges are just lightly golden and the middle looks slightly uncooked.</li>
        <li>Let cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes then transfer with a cookie spatula to a cooling rack and let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
