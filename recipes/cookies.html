    <h3 id='recipe'>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, more as needed</li>
        <li>1 can green chiles, (optional)</li>
        <li>1 can black beans, drained</li>
        <li>12 flour tortillas, 6-inch</li>
        <li>24 ounces salsa</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>3 cup shredded Mexican Cheese Blend</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C) and grease the bottom of a 9Ã—13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef until browned and completely cooked through, breaking it into small pieces as it cooks. Transfer beef to a bowl and set aside. Discard the remaining grease.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat, add onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Add cooked ground beef, taco seasoning, green chiles, and beans. Pour in 1/2 cup of water and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Add 1-2 Tbsp more water if needed. Remove pan from heat.</li>
        <li>Use 3 tacos cut in half and 1 whole taco to line the baking dish (see picture above). Spread 1/3 of the salsa on top and then 1/2 of the meat mixture. Drop 1/2 of the sour cream over the meat and spread out with a spatula. Top with 1 cup of cheese. Repeat layers. Top with 4 tortillas, remaining salsa, and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
